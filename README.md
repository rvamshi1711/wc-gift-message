My Response:
If our plugin needs to work with 10,000+ users, there are some simple but important things you can do to keep it running smoothly. First, make sure to use special features or tools that are designed to handle large amounts of order data quickly, like WooCommerce’s built-in solutions for storing orders efficiently. Regularly clean up and organize the database to keep things running fast. Using caching can help by saving frequently used information so the system doesn’t have to work as hard to find it each time. It’s also important to set up your database so that it can quickly find the information it needs, which is called indexing. Stick to using the official tools and methods provided by WooCommerce for managing orders, because these are made to be efficient. Finally, choose a good hosting service that can handle big loads and try to schedule big jobs, like updating lots of orders at once, for times when not many people are using the site. Following these steps will help your plugin stay fast and reliable, even as the number of orders grows.
